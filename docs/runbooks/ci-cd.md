# CI/CD Runbook

## Current CI

Ordinary CI runs without enterprise IAM credentials. It is a single pipeline,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

It runs on every push to every branch, on every pull request, on `v*` tags and
on manual dispatch. Running on feature branches too is deliberate: whoever is
working on a branch sees the suites go red while they are still developing,
instead of discovering it when the branch is already up for merge.

The pipeline has five jobs; all but the secret scan run through Docker Compose:

- **backend**: builds the app image and runs the PHP checks: Composer manifest validation, Pint (format), Larastan/PHPStan (static analysis), Pest and Xdebug line/branch coverage, and finally `composer audit` on the production dependencies. Xdebug is installed only when `COMPOSER_INSTALL_DEV=true`, so it is absent from the production image. The audit runs last, like its npm counterpart in the frontend job, so an advisory never hides the test outcome.
- **frontend**: runs the Angular SPA suite on the Node tool image: OpenAPI contract lint, generated client drift check, ESLint, typecheck, Jest tests with statement/function/branch coverage, production build, and a production-only `npm audit` at HIGH. The typecheck covers the test suites as well as the app (`tsconfig.spec-typecheck.json`): Jest transpiles specs without checking types, so without this step a test could reference fields that do not exist on the generated API model and still pass.
- **coverage-diff**: downloads the Cobertura and LCOV artifacts from the two test jobs and applies the changed-line gate with `diff-cover==10.4.1` against the base commit of the triggering event: `github.event.pull_request.base.sha` on pull requests, `github.event.before` on pushes. When the event has no usable base (branch or tag creation, `workflow_dispatch`, a commit no longer reachable) the job falls back to the merge-base with the default branch and emits a warning. A branch ref is never used as the base: on a push it already points to the pushed commit and the diff would be empty. The two stacks are measured in separate invocations, because `diff-cover` refuses XML and LCov reports in the same run; each report only describes its own files, so the two measurements never overlap and no line is counted twice.
- **stack** (static infrastructure/observability checks (Terraform `fmt`/`init`/`validate`, OTel Collector and Prometheus config), production image build, Trivy scan (`vuln,secret,config` at HIGH/CRITICAL), LocalStack Terraform apply, Angular SPA build and upload to the LocalStack S3 bucket, HTTPS smoke of the served stack (SPA served via the local CDN emulator) a separate Nginx: with deep-link fallback, `/api`/`/health`/`/ready`, blocked surfaces, observability dashboards behind basic auth), accessibility (axe/Pa11y plus an enforced-CSP smoke), and conditional publish of the two custom images (`mvp-app`, `mvp-nginx`) to GHCR.
- **secrets**: scans the whole Git history with gitleaks (pinned image), so a secret removed by a later commit is still caught in the commits that introduced it. Exceptions live in `.gitleaks.toml` and cover only the local demo credentials.

Supporting workflows:

- `.github/workflows/aws-smoke.yml` is manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`, never blocking) and smoke-tests real S3, Textract and Bedrock. See "AWS Smoke" below.
- `.github/workflows/mirror-images.yml` mirrors the external base images used by CI onto GHCR (scheduled weekly and on image-list change), so the jobs pull from an authenticated mirror instead of anonymous, rate-limited registries.

All jobs use a `concurrency` group per workflow/ref with `cancel-in-progress`, so superseded pushes do not waste runner minutes. Jobs that pull the Compose stack pre-pull images with retry/backoff and log in to GHCR (and to Docker Hub when the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`/`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets exist) to absorb registry rate limits on shared runners.

## Required Gates Before Deployment

- Backend: Composer validation, Pint formatting, Larastan/PHPStan static analysis, Pest tests, line coverage and branch coverage, production `composer audit`.
- Frontend: OpenAPI contract lint, generated client drift check, ESLint, typecheck, Jest tests, statement/function/branch coverage, production build, production `npm audit`.
- Changed code: backend and frontend diff coverage at 80%, measured one stack at a time.
- OTel Collector and Prometheus config validation.
- Terraform fmt and validate for LocalStack infrastructure.
- Trivy image scan for runtime images (HIGH/CRITICAL).
- LocalStack Terraform apply, Angular SPA build and upload to S3, and HTTPS smoke (SPA serving with deep-link fallback, API, blocked surfaces).
- Accessibility smoke (axe/Pa11y) and enforced-CSP smoke against the served SPA.
- Container image build (and conditional GHCR publish).

## Dependency advisory gates

Node and PHP dependencies are both audited, but the two ecosystems need different thresholds.

`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` is enough on the Node side: the npm advisory database
always carries a severity, so filtering on it is reliable.

PHP needs `scripts/ci/check-composer-advisories.mjs`, because `composer audit` cannot filter by
severity at all — it either passes or fails on everything. The script reads the JSON report and
fails on `high`, `critical` **and on advisories with no severity declared**, letting only explicit
`low` and `moderate` through. That last case is not a corner case: the PHP advisory source
(`FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories`) often leaves `severity` at `null`, as it did for
CVE-2026-54133 on `mtdowling/jmespath.php`, which GitHub rates 9.8 critical. A gate filtering
strictly on `high` would have let that one through.

Two flags carry weight:

- `--locked` audits what the lockfile declares instead of the `vendor/` baked into the image, so
  the gate does not silently describe whatever was installed when the image was last built.
- `--abandoned=report` is required, not cosmetic: the project config sets `audit.abandoned` to
  `fail`, so without it the job would break the day a package is marked abandoned — which is not a
  vulnerability.

When an advisory cannot be fixed because it depends on an upstream release, declare it in
`composer.json` under `config.audit.ignore` with a reason, so the exception is explicit and
reviewable, instead of weakening the gate for everything.

## Coverage gates

The source of truth is `coverage-thresholds.json`:

- backend: 80% lines and 70% branches;
- frontend: 80% statements, 80% functions and 70% branches;
- changed lines: 80%, read from the same file by the `coverage-diff` job.

The minimum values are strict: total coverage below any minimum always fails the job, without tolerance or manually maintained coverage baselines. Jest enforces the exact frontend minimums through `coverageThreshold.global`. On the backend `scripts/ci/check-coverage-thresholds.mjs` is the only global gate and validates every aggregate metric: Pest no longer passes `--min`, which repeated the same line threshold on the same metric, hardcoded in the workflow and blind to branches. The separate changed-line gate keeps new and modified code at 80% coverage, following a Clean as You Code policy.

Local commands:

```bash
make backend-coverage
make frontend-coverage
```

Backend path coverage is intentionally slower than the ordinary Pest suite and uses a 1 GB PHP memory limit. Reports are generated under `coverage/` and `apps/frontend/coverage/`; both paths are ignored by Git. The CI uploads Cobertura and backend HTML reports, plus LCOV, JSON and frontend HTML reports.

PHPUnit writes the Cobertura report with the container paths: `<source>` holds the absolute path of the covered root and every `filename` is relative to it. `scripts/ci/normalize-cobertura-paths.mjs` rewrites `<source>` to a repo-relative path before the report leaves the backend job, because `diff-cover` resolves each class as `join(<source>, filename)`. Without that step no changed file is matched, the gate measures zero lines and passes silently; the script fails the job instead if the report does not have the expected shape. The `coverage-diff` job then runs one invocation per stack:

```bash
diff-cover coverage/backend/cobertura.xml \
  --compare-branch="$BASE_SHA" --fail-under=80
diff-cover coverage/frontend/lcov.info \
  --compare-branch="$BASE_SHA" --fail-under=80
```

Both invocations always run and their exit codes are combined, so a failure on one stack still produces the other's report. A commit that touches a single stack leaves the other invocation with no measured line, which `diff-cover` treats as a pass; the log reports base, head and measured lines for each stack and adds a notice when no line was measured. The job publishes HTML, Markdown and JSON reports per stack. Coverage data artifacts are retained for 1 day, HTML and Markdown reports for 7. If a stack smoke or accessibility step fails, the `stack-diagnostics` artifact contains `docker compose ps`, timestamped Compose logs and Docker disk usage. The stack is still stopped by the following `if: always()` cleanup step.

## AWS Smoke

`aws-smoke.yml` verifies the real AWS integrations (S3 put/head/delete, Textract `detect-document-text`, Bedrock `converse`) and supports two credential modes, in order of preference:

1. **OIDC (target state)**: pass the IAM role ARN as the `aws_role_arn` input; the workflow assumes it via GitHub OIDC (`id-token: write`). No stored credentials.
2. **Ephemeral secrets (interim)**: load short-lived session credentials as `AWS_REAL_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_REAL_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_REAL_SESSION_TOKEN` repository secrets right before an important PR, run the workflow, then let them expire. Long-lived static credentials must not be stored.

Non-sensitive configuration comes from repository variables (`AWS_REAL_REGION`, `AWS_REAL_S3_BUCKET`, `BEDROCK_REGION`, `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`, ...) with defaults aligned to `docker-compose.yml`. When neither credential source is available the workflow skips cleanly with a notice.
